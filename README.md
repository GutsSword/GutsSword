## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Dokuz EylÃ¼l University Computer Science Department in 2024. I completed my internship in the IT infrastructure in the field of ERP software development. Since my university years, I have worked on monolithic and microservice architectures, focusing on backend deployment with .NET technologies. I developed API development and basic front-end applications.
